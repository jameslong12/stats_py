## Jupyter notebooks for statistics modules

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for series of statistics modules designed for an introductory course. These modules were originally created by Steve Wallace and Ken Chu.

### Contents

These notebooks are organized in five modules with blank notebooks for students and corresponding answers. The topics covered are:

1. Basics of statistics
2. Hypothesis testing
3. Regression and correlation
4. ANOVA
5. Two-way ANOVA

### Setup

Jupyter notebooks can be run locally from a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). To install the necessary packages in the virtual environment, run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

From there, the Jupyter environment can be started by simply running:

`jupyter notebook`

Alternatively, these notebooks can be uploaded to a Google drive for use with [Google Colaboratory](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/).
