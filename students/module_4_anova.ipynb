    "Investigators are measuring how regular use of a commonly used painkiller affects blood clotting in patients over time, assuming a significance of 0.05. The experiment was designed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Eight subjects were gathered. Each had their blood tested for clotting time (minutes) before use of the painkiller as a control.\n",
    "*   Subjects began regular use of the painkiller. Clotting time was then measured three months after drug use began.\n",
    "*   Clotting time was then measured six months after drug use began.\n",

    "Before we dive into the Python, discuss briefly:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Would a regular or repeated measures ANOVA be appropriate to assess the drug's effect on clotting time?\n",
    "*   Propose a null and alternate hypothesis for this study.\n",
    "*   List the assumptions that must be valid (or close to valid) when drawing conclusions from your test.\n"
